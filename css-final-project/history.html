    <p>During the eartly 19th centruey Menomonee Falls was home to native groups, such as the Menomonee, Chippewa, and Algonquin. By 1845 the settlement had several homes and buisinesses with a rough population of 100. In 1890 a rail link to Milwaukee was created. Two years later it was incorporated as a village. The first public telephone service was offered in 1902 and in 1907 a local eletric plant supplied electricity. The 1910s saw the first water mains and 1924 saw the first sewer lines. Back in 1910 car sales began with 12 cars being registered in Menomonee Falls by 1912. In 1930 a new municipal building was constructed which became home to the Village offices, the Fire and Police Departments, and the Public Library. Later in 1935 all streets received signs and all buildings were assigned numbers. After WWII growth returned and was accompanied by five new subdivisions. The Town of Menomonee was incorporated into the village in 1958, which took the land area from 2 square miles to 32 square miles. The village celebrated its centennial in 1992. In 2008, the village adopted the "Menomonee Falls Comprehensive Plan" which will be used to guide the development of the village fo the following 20 years.
