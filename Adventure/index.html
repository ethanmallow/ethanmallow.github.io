<dd style="font-family:Tahoma">The first attarction we saw while at Rüdesheim was the Niederwald Monument. To get up to the monument we first had to ride a cable car. Once up top we were able to walk around and view the magnificent statue that was built to commemorate German unification under <em>Kaiser Wilhelm I</em>. Once we were satisfied with every view we made our way down. Instead of taking the cable cars back down we decided to talk the winding paths through the hillside vineyards. While it was scenic it was rather long and tiresome.</dd>

<dd style="font-family:Tahoma">After the first nights stay in Rüdesheim, which was rather warm due to the lack of air conditioning, we got to enjoy muddling about the town and at night we got to witness the amazing firework show. This show was made up of fireworks launching from <strong>50</strong> some cruise boats on the river which lastet about and hour and a half.</dd>

<!--Definition List-->
<dd style="font-family:Tahoma">In our final day in Rüdesheim we were able to enjoy a smooth trip up and down the Rhein on a cruise ship and get a riverview tour of Rüdesheim. While on the cruise the major landmarks, buildings, and the like were pointed out to us over speakers and in several languages. This cruise allowed us to view the amazing landscapes and locations that we would not have seen due to the lack of time that we had in the town.</dd>
